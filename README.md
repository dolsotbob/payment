# üõçÔ∏è Web3 Payment Store (Permit + Cashback + Vault)

This is a full-stack Web3 payment prototype project built as part of Rocket Boostcamp‚Äôs blockchain engineer training program.  
It‚Äôs designed to simulate a decentralized online store where users can make payments using ERC20 tokens, receive automatic cashback, and have the remaining balance securely managed via Vault and Timelock smart contracts.

## üöÄ Project Goals

- Learn how to build and deploy Solidity smart contracts
- Explore the full transaction lifecycle from frontend to contract
- Design a Web3 UX that is intuitive for Web2 users
- Integrate backend APIs and database for real-world usage
- Open source the project to share what I‚Äôve learned and improve it with the community

## üß± Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (ERC20, Permit, Vault, Timelock)
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Backend**: NestJS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Dev Tools**: Hardhat, Ethers.js, GitHub, Vercel, Render

## üîê Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Permit-based ERC20 token payments** (gas-efficient)
- üí∏ **Automatic cashback** logic triggered upon successful payment
- üè¶ **Vault** contract for secure fund holding
- ‚è≥ **Timelock** for protected withdrawal operations
- üßæ **Shipping info + user auth** handled via backend
- üåê Designed for **Web2-friendly UX** (MetaMask login + simple UI)

## üìÖ Timeline

- Project ideation started in **late June 2025**
- Currently in development (as of August 2025)
- Preparing for open-source release and live demo deployment
